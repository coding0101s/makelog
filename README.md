# makelog

makelog is a minimal DSL for file-based logging.

This DSL is extracted from the shell grammar of a custom operating system
I am developing. Some features were added, and many were intentionally
restricted to keep the language simple and predictable.

makelog is designed for file I/O only.
Console output is not supported by design.
